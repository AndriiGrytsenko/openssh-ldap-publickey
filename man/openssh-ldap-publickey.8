.SH NAME
openssh-ldap-publickey \- Wrapper for OpenSSH to store public keys inside the OpenLDAP entry.
.SH SYNOPSIS
openssh-ldap-publickey [-hv] [USERNAME]
.SH DESCRIPTION
You create entry for user from OpenLdap and add attribut 'sshPublicKey' with PublicKey to this user. When user try login through the ssh, OpenSSH calls /usr/bin/openssh-ldap-publickey script which in its turn makes request to OpenLdap asking for sshPublicKey attribute value.

Ldap connection parameters are used by openssh-ldap-publickey is taken from /etc/ldap.conf, /etc/pam_ldap.conf or /etc/libnss-ldap.conf file. Keep in mind that 'pam_filter' value from /etc/ldap.conf, /etc/pam_ldap.conf or /etc/libnss-ldap.conf is used by openssh-ldap-publickey.

Basically, it looks similar to this scheme
ssh-client -> ssh-server -> openssh-ldap-publickey -> openldap server -> openldap server is looking for attribute sshPublicKey inside user's entry in Base DN

Change should be made in sshd_config:

AuthorizedKeysCommand /usr/bin/openssh-ldap-publickey

AuthorizedKeysCommandRunAs nobody
